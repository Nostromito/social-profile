## Overview

My third attempt at a recreation of a FEM project. Every projext gets easier as it gets harder. Finding ways to do new challenges is always fun and keeps me on my toes. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Solution URL: [Solution](https://github.com/Nostromito/social-profile)
- Live Site URL: [Live site](https://nostromito.github.io/social-profile/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to expand an element and shape it in order to make an operational link.

### Continued development

Most importantly, I want to be able to clean up my code and work on the fluidity of my css/html. It feels clunky to me, so smoothing that out is my main goal.
